    <p> &emsp; A land of vast distances and rich natural resources, Canada became a self-governing dominion in 1867, while retaining ties to the British crown. Canada repatriated its constitution from the UK in 1982, severing a final colonial tie.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> &emsp; Economically and technologically, the nation has developed in parallel with the US, its neighbor to the south across the world's longest international border. Canada faces the political challenges of meeting public demands for quality improvements in health care, education, social services, and economic competitiveness, as well as responding to the particular concerns of predominantly francophone Quebec.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>  &emsp;Canada also aims to develop its diverse energy resources while maintaining its commitment to the environment.
